The popcorn's been popped, the sweatpants are on, and the evening is your oyster. Your next challenge: Figuring out exactly which of the best movies available to you is the one you're going to watch tonight. No matter what you're looking for—a rom-com, a murder mystery, a sad film, a great musical movie—there are plenty of must-watch films in your chosen genre to settle in with for the first (but probably not the last) time.

We movie lovers at Marie Claire know how time-consuming picking a great movie can be, so we did the work for you. We combed through movie rankings, critical reviews, and award nominations, and spoke to fellow pop culture fans to bring you this list of crucial must-watch films. Of course, you can expect to see well-known classics like Casablanca and The Sound of Music on this list, in addition to movies from iconic directors like Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, and Alfred Hitchcock. But modern classics like Everything Everywhere All At Once and Get Out stand up just as well and are on this list, too. 

The below must-watch movies are modern classics, the best of the best, the essential films that millions of people are probably jealous that you're getting to see for the first time. (A bonus: You’ll also find must-know facts and exactly why each film is considered the “best.”) Ahead, in no particular order: The best movies of all time.

The Best Romance Movies of All Time
There are a few things you can (almost) always expect from a romance movie: a love story (duh!); attractive protagonists; and a happy ending—usually. Maybe you need to be reminded that true love is out there. Or maybe you need to show your partner what real romance looks like. Some of the movies on this list are funny, and some are the ultimate in sad romance films, but there’s one thing all of these romantic films have in common: They're sure to pull on your heartstrings and make you believe in love all over again.

For fans of: fall and friends-to-lovers

If you haven't seen When Harry Met Sally, you probably know it from this famous "I'll have what she's having" scene.

For fans of: journalism and screwball comedy 

Carey Grant and Rosalind Russell play a formerly married couple—he an editor, she an investigative reporter—who have to team up for one last assignment. Of course, the fact that he hired her only after finding out she was engaged to someone new might have something to do with it, but Russell is hilarious and their chemistry is bananas in this romance.

The Best Classic Movies of All Time
Less of a genre and more of a distinction, we define "classic movies" as the kind of film that changed their respective genres forever. Being familiar with the films on this list will set you apart from the casual pop culture fan and put you on the road to becoming a movie buff. For a film to be a classic in our book, it needs to have some years on it (all of these films on our list came out before 1990), be universally loved, and had a major cultural impact. The classic movies below all check those boxes.

REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE (1955)

Two words for you: James! Dean! The old Hollywood icon's second to last film, as teenager Jim Stark, before his untimely death in 1955 ended up being one of his most celebrated. The unlikely bond shared on-screen between him, John "Plato" Crawford (Sal Mineo), and Judy (Natalie Wood) gave American youths at the time a movie where they could finally see themselves on the screen.

For fans of: courtroom dramas and realistic thrillers 

This classic film is ostensibly about a dozen white men on a jury arguing over whether a young Puerto Rican man actually killed his father (the class and race dynamics feel unfortunately familiar, 60-plus years later). But it's really about prejudice and stereotype and the assumptions we carry with us every day without realizing it. If you didn't get to watch this one in school, watch it now.

Yes, there are three parts to this trilogy that might require a night of bingeing. But there's really nothing like Francis Ford Coppola's depiction of the mob family of Don Vito Corleone. It's a chilling to the bone, action-packed story that's not one to miss.

For fans of: tension-building suspense and iconic theme songs 

When Steven Spielberg made this movie, I’m unsure if he knew it would become the face of anti-shark propaganda, and make a whole generation scared to get in the water. Regardless, this movie about a sheriff, marine biologist, and fisherman hunting down a shark that’s terrorizing their beach town is a must-see.

Rotten Tomatoes Score: 91%

For fans of: slice-of-life stories and driving messages 

Spike Lee acts and directs in a film that marries comedy and drama perfectly. Roger Ebert's review(opens in new tab) is pretty spot-on, but to summarize: Lee builds a community in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, teeming with life and tension on the hottest day of the year. And then he rips it all apart. But it's so much more compelling than even that description. Lee handles all his characters with love, and there's no one who's truly evil, despite spot-on and heart-wrenching commentary about racism, classism, and poverty.

Director: Stanley Kubrick

Stars: Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd

Rotten Tomatoes Score: 82%

For fans of: Stephen King and eerie settings 

Jack Nicholson is on this list a few times, but this classic horror movie is probably his most well-known role. The Torrance family—husband Jack, wife Wendy, and son Danny—are staying in the Overlook Hotel during the winter. Then, the hotel begins to come alive with a terrible, terrifying evil. Stephen King famously hated this adaptation, because Stanley Kubrick takes out all the empathy from the patriarch (Nicholson, playing crazy like he was born to do it). But it makes the story even more powerful. Viewed through today's lens, it's also a haunting look at the effects of domestic violence.

Rotten Tomatoes Score: 90%

For fans of: feminism and twisted revenge

This very dark comedy juxtaposes one woman's insatiable quest to avenge her best friend's tragic assault in front of a backdrop of all things frilly, pink, and sweet. That stark contrast only makes the movie's incredibly intense climax that much more shocking. Promising Young Woman was nominated for five Oscars in 2021, including Best Picture, Best Actress for Carey Mulligan, and a history-making Best Director nod for Emerald Fennell.

Rotten Tomatoes Score: 91%

For fans of: creepy villains and outer space

This movie is trippy and a bit hard to follow, but it's absolutely required viewing. Stanley Kubrick takes us from the dawn of the human species to the dawn of a totally new species in just a few hours, and his view of space and space travel set the standard for a thousand sci-fi films to come. More importantly, it's compelling and totally, totally terrifying. It's aged really well, despite being made over 50 years ago.

Based very, very loosely on the book of the same name, Natalie Portman is a scientist who goes in search of her husband. She enters Area X, a mutated, trippy landscape that's been expanding ever since it was hit by a meteorite. And shit just keeps getting weirder and scarier. This is directed by Alex Garland, the same guy who did Ex Machina(opens in new tab) (another fascinating, freaky watch). Honestly, he's becoming the next big sci-fi director, and this proves it.

For fans of: monster movies and amusement parks  

It's a little hard to believe that the Schindler's List director also came up with this dino adventure movie, but what's even more impressive is that the two films came out mere months apart. This could not be more different, but if you're looking for a film about these prehistoric creatures, stick to the classic. There's so much loving attention paid to the dinosaurs' look—there isn't a ton of CGI, with a greater reliance on practical effects—but more importantly, the human characters are just as interesting. Samuel L. Jackson, in the best cameo of all time.

Anthony Hopkins' performance in this film made Hannibal Lecter the creepiest villain of the past few decades, who isn't even the actual villain of this film.

For fans of: chilling historical periods and brutal atmospheres 

A movie about the Holocaust is almost guaranteed to be poignant, but under Stephen Spielberg's expert direction, this one surprises with its restraint. That's deliberate—the sadness and symbolism build throughout the film so that you have a full sense of what happened, who did it, and why it matters so, so much. The movie's in black and white, with the smallest pop of color to offer a moment of hope and then (devastatingly) all possible heartbreak in one unforgettable image.

If you've ever wondered whether your life is just one big sitcom, The Truman Show illustrates what happens when one man, played by Jim Carrey, realizes that his entire life is scripted for television.
